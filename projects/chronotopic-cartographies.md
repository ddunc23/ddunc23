title: Chronotopic Cartographies
---

[Chronotopic Cartographies](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/chronotopic-cartographies/) is a research project investigating the spatial character of the literary text led by [Professor Sally Bushell](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/english-literature-and-creative-writing/about-us/staff/sally-bushell) at the Department of English and Creative Writing, Lancaster University. Where previous projects approaching this topic have sought to ground the literary text in real-world geographies, Chronotopic Cartographies draws on the literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin's notion of the 'chronotope', narratology and graph theory to produce visualisations and maps of texts which don't necessarily have real-world referents.
