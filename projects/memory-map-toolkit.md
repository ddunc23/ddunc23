title: Memory Map Toolkit
---

The Memory Map Toolkit is a forthcoming open-source software package for documenting culture and history through interactive maps. Drawing on learning from the [Memory Map of the Jewish East End](/projects/memory-map-jewish-east-end) and [the Survey of London Whitechapel Initiative](/projects/survey-of-london-whitechapel/) it aims to provide a robust platform to allow people and communities to tell stories about place.

At present the toolkit is being road-tested by community groups in Forest Gate and Somers Town in London and Toxteth in Liverpool to document subjects as diverse musical history, social housing and permaculture gardening. 

As soon as it is ready for release, with some knowledge of how to set up a web server you'll be able to download the Toolkit from GitHub and start creating your own memory maps.
