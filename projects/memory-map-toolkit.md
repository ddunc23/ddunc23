Memory Mapper is an open-source software package for documenting culture and history through interactive maps. Drawing on learning from the [Memory Map of the Jewish East End](/projects/memory-map-jewish-east-end) and [the Survey of London Whitechapel Initiative](/projects/survey-of-london-whitechapel/) provides robust platform to allow people and communities to tell stories about place.

The code and instructions for getting set up can be found on the [project GitHub page](https://memorymapper.github.io/).
