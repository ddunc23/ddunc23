[British Monuments Related to Slavery](https://www.britishmonumentsrelatedtoslavery.net/) is an interactive map of public statues in the United Kingdom with connections to the transatlantic slave trade. Led by [Dr Gavin Grindon](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/busman/staff/academic/profiles/grindong.html), the project has created a new dataset exploring the links between Britain's colonial history and the contemporary built environment.
