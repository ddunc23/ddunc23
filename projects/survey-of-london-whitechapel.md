The [Survey of London Whitechapel Iniative](https://surveyoflondon.org) is an interactive map website documenting the history of the London parish of Whitechapel.

Founded in 1894 by the Arts and Crafts architect C. R. Ashbee as a small volunteer project, and initiated with studies of parts of East London, the Survey of London has evolved into a detailed area-by-area chronicle of urban development, encompassing buildings of all types and periods.

In 2016, an in-depth study of Whitechapel was launched. Whitechapel is the inner fulcrum of London’s East End, a district with a long and rich history, currently in the throes of intense change. In an exciting departure and a return to the Survey’s founding ethos that has been made possible by a major grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (reference AH/N00146X/1) and the involvement of the Bartlett Faculty’s Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, the Survey’s exploration of Whitechapel’s history is being rooted in this collaborative map-based website.
