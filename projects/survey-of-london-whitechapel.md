title: Survey of London - Whitechapel Initiative
---

The [Survey of London Whitechapel Iniative](https://surveyoflondon.org) is an interactive map website documenting the history of the London parish of Whitechapel.

Founded in 1894 by the Arts and Crafts architect C. R. Ashbee as a small volunteer project, and initiated with studies of parts of East London, the Survey of London has evolved into a detailed area-by-area chronicle of urban development, encompassing buildings of all types and periods.

In 2016, an in-depth study of Whitechapel was launched. Whitechapel is the inner fulcrum of London’s East End, a district with a long and rich history, currently in the throes of intense change. In an exciting departure and a return to the Survey’s founding ethos  that has been made possible by a major grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (reference AH/N00146X/1) and the involvement of the Bartlett Faculty’s Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, the Survey’s exploration of Whitechapel’s history is being rooted in this collaborative map-based website.

It is designed to involve the public (you) in compiling information about the area’s sites, to accommodate many voices for many histories. The aim is to bring together individual stories and knowledge about housing, commerce, religion and entertainment, wealth and poverty, dissent, reform and conflict, and more besides. Immigration is a primary historical fact in Whitechapel’s history, embracing over centuries German, Irish, East European, Jewish and Bengali Muslim settlements, among others. We warmly invite you to explore the website and to make your own contributions.
