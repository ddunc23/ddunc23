I'm an academic, researcher and developer with a background in Digital Humanities and Cultural Studies. I have a PhD in English Literature from the University of Manchester and currently hold Research Fellowships at [The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/) and [the Department of English and Creative Writing, Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/english-literature-and-creative-writing/). My digital skills include web development (with a specialism in web mapping), GIS, and data visualisation using Python and Javascript.

My current research interests are [web mapping for culture and heritage](https://jewisheastendmemorymap.org/), [data visualisation for literary criticism](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/chronotopic-cartographies/) and [immersive locative storytelling](https://preamblestudio.co.uk/).
