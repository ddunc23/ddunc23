## Dr Duncan Hay

My research focuses on the relationship between culture, space, and technology. My PhD thesis examined the work of the London-based writer and filmmaker Iain Sinclair. Drawing heavily on the work of Walter Benjamin, the writings of the Situationist International, and Fredric Jameson, it reads his poetry and prose as an attempt to rediscover writing as a political, socially-oriented praxis in the wake of the failure of the 20th Century avant-gardes to achieve their revolutionary aims. 

In addition to my critical scholarship, I have high-level skills in digital humanities methodologies, particularly web-based mapping and data visualisation. I am currently Senior Research Fellow at the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL, I have been lead designer and developer on [the Survey of London Whitechapel Initiative](https://surveyoflondon.org/), an interdisciplinary project drawing on expertise in architectural history, data visualisation and GIS.

I am currently Principal Investigator for [Memory Mapper](https://memorymapper.github.io/), an open-source web mapping builds upon learning from the Survey of London Whitechapel project.

In addition to my work at UCL, I have held Research Associate positions at the Department of English and Creative Writing, Lancaster, and the Sussex Humanities Lab. At Lancaster, I was technical lead on [Chronotopic Cartographies](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/chronotopic-cartographies/), which uses network analysis and Mikhail Bakhtin’s notion of the ‘chronotope’ to generate data visualisations of the spatiality and temporality of the literary text. At Sussex, I was responsible for implementing a linked open data solution for the [Tools of Knowledge](https://toolsofknowledge.org/) project.
