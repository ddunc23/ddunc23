## Welcome
We look forward to welcoming you at CASA! We have (loosely) themed the week around ideas relating to neighbourhoods, change, and complexity. Over the course of the week weâ€™ll be talking about urban systems, about gentrification, about Arduino sensors, and about maps as story-telling devices. 

We hope to share with you some of our excitement about what is possible in an interdisciplinary research environment where architects, computer scientists, artists and planners (amongst many others!) work together.

We'll be updating this page through the week as we complete the various activities we have planned, so it will form a set of resources for you to refer to after the end of the placement.

### Venue
We'll be working at [One Pool Street](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/case-studies/2024/feb/one-pool-street) at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford. As mentioned in the introductory email, please come to the main entrance for 10am on Monday morning, and bring a pen and paper with you.

We should be finished for 4pm each day.
